      <p id="chapter1">
      SHUXXUR is an audiovisual duo by Arash Azadi and Hasmik Badoyan. It was formed in 2019 in Yerevan, Armenia. Their first collaboration was at the premiere of Azadi's album "Mathematical Labyrinth" at Poligraf. They did a large scale audiovisual performance at Planetarium 1 at Saint Petersburg during the Mawaheb festival in 2021. They have performed at GeekPicninc festival in Moscow in 2022 and recorded a live album at Garage Studios.
      Their work is centered around indeterminancy by using generative art tools for sound and visuals. As free improvisation is the core of their practice, the outcome of the performances or the recordings are always unknown. Sonically their work can be considered on the margins of Noise Music and sound art. They mainly use laptops to generate sound and visuals.
